# Weather API 

## Create a weather app using HTML, CSS and JavaScript!

* The user should be able to type in a city name and receive information about the weather of that city. 

### Project Architecture

* The project will use modules for functionality that will be imported to your index.js file. 

#### Structure the project as following: 
* In the index.js file, you should store the functionality of what the user is searching in the weather app's input field. You should create a function to fetch the api's data (day 1 of project). **Note**: add functionality so that the user is able to search all cities.
* In another file, create a function which gets the date and time to display to the user. 
* In yet another file, display the rest of weather data to the user e.g. temperature, type of weather (cloudy/sunny) etc. 


**Bonus 1** Create a toggle which allows users to display data in either Celcius or Fahrenheit. Create another file to store these functions.
**Bonus 2** Display a weather icon depending on the weather data. 
**Bonus 3** Display the weather data for the next few days. 


**Do not forget to import and export your files to the appropriate locations.**
